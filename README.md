# My Portfolio (*Still* a Rough Draft!)

Welcome to my very first professional portfolio! It may not look like much now, but over time it will become fleshed out with all sorts of visual and technical flourishes.

## Projects

Since my last update, I have three new deployed projects, in addition to the refactor:

* [HTML Refactoring Project](https://rmccallie.github.io/refactoring-html-project/)

* [Password Generator Project](https://rmccallie.github.io/Password-Generator-Project/)

* [Work Day Scheduler Project](https://rmccallie.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler-Project/)

* [Medical Assistance Locator App](https://kennedysam168.github.io/Group-Project-1/)

...and remember, Always Be Coding!
